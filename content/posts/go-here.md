Starting in November I am going to experiment with a new way to write posts for the blog. I am going to take one day every three weeks and dedicate it to writing 21 posts. The hypothesis is as follows:

1. The quality will be better. Waiting until 11pm each to write is surely not for quality.
1. The content will be more meaningful. I will have 1-21 days to digest and think about topics before writing them down.
1. It will help me retain more knowledge through [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#:~:text=Spaced%20repetition%20is%20an%20evidence,is%20usually%20performed%20with%20flashcards.&text=Although%20the%20principle%20is%20useful,retain%20them%20indefinitely%20in%20memory.).
1. Whenever I hear, read, or think about something that I want to write about I can jot it down, knowing that I will come back to it soon.
1. I tend to do silly 1-2 week experiments. Writing posts every three weeks fits nicely with that rhythm.
1. This practice will be a great excuse for coffee and a donut.
