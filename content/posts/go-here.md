I often think about what I would do if I have a billion dollars. Near the top of the list would be to create a place with excellent mental health and community service skills. I am sure many places exist, but I want my own.

Then, when I see a homeless person or someone having a break on the streets, rather than feel sad and lament the fact that I don't have the skills or the heart to help them, I would be able to give them a card and say "How are you? It looks like you could use some help. If you want some help with anything go here and we will try."

I'm sure this wouldn't be the best allocation of resources, but I am tired of seeing people struggling on the streets and simply walking past them.
