While fasting, you find yourself with a surprising amount of extra time on your hands. While the fasted stated of your body prohibits you from hiking Everest or marathon training, your options for how to spend this gift are almost endless. During this fast I am choosing two activities:

1. Extra long walks with our dog Frank. The weather is still decent here in Philadelphia and my man Frank loves being outside. Additionally it will be a nice form exercise, albeit low intensity, which is hard to come by when fasting.
2. Side projects. I have a few side projects that I am juggling and having an extra hour each day to fiddle around is going to be a delight.

How would you spend an extra hour or two each day if you had it?
