I have been abnormally happy the last few weeks and I believe I now know why: I have the feeling that traditionally comes after a silent meditation retreat. Somehow what normally comes after has arrived before!

Here is my attempt to describe it:

- First, it is not really a feeling, it is more stable than a feeling. It has the quality that it has always been with you and will never leave.
- The main content is that suffering is now, if not impossible, totally optional.
- The word *living* makes more sense than before. Each moment arrives almost as a pleasant unexpected surprise. It's not about what each moment contains, but about how it arrives.

I know my description will mean almost nothing to almost everybody. But that is the best I can describe it.
