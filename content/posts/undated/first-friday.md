Today marks the first observance of First Friday, where I attempt to write blog posts for the entire month in one day.

I also want to extend this idea a bit further: First Thursday might become the day where I have a conversation with my fantastic counselor. And First Wednesday might become the day where I spend as much time as is necessary to put nagging issues in order and *do the books* for the prior month.

Batching and scheduling are great luxuries that my freedom permits and that I often overlook. They are also great excuses for coffee and a donut!
