One of the main practicalities you take out of a residential meditation retreat is the imperative of community if you want to continue practicing over the long-haul. Every inspiring teacher and yogi have one thing in common (apart from being impressive... smart-ass): they were a member of a community of "like-spirited" people. This seems like the lowest hanging fruit of motivation hacks in history: surround yourself with people with natural interest in things that you are motivated to make a part of your life.

Good news: We live in a big city. We have the internet. And Buddhists are very inclusive people.

Hopefully more to come on this topic.
