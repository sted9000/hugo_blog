Both Mica and I had frustrating days. Our minds were dispersed, we were not able to focus, and we were irritable. I am convinced that these days are inevitable. Fewer? Sure. But zero? Nope.

So then the question becomes _how do you assess days like today?_ And I think a simple and good rule of thumb is:
1. Were you able to make even the slightest progress in your endeavour?
2. Did you maintain a positive outlook and remain kind?

If you can navigate your way to answering yes to those two questions, even though today was frustrating and not productive, you will most likely be back on your game tomorrow. The train did not come off the track. You live to fight another day.
