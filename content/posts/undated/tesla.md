My friend is getting a Tesla! I almost want to fly down to visit just to get a chance to drive it.

The coolest thing about Tesla (and there are many cool things), is that I never imagined driving a life-sized remote control car â€” and that is what I hear driving a Tesla is like. I imagined taking off in car like a gas-powered Ferrari, but nothing with the zip and smoothness of an electric motor.

I am excited for my old friend and his new toy. Enjoy.
