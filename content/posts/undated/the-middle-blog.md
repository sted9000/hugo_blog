A new blog I want to start writing is one that explores the both the poetic and practical path navigating between a fully worldly life and the life of someone who takes serious (most of the) Buddhist teachings. I know others have talked in these terms â€” such as [Naval and Rational Buddhism](https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/rational-buddhism). 

If the project continues over ten or twenty years, no matter the outcome, it would be a cool document to look back on. And would perhaps be of use to others curious about what such a path could look like.
