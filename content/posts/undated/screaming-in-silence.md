This time next week I will be sitting in silence. The Tuesday after that, I will be sitting in silence, and the following Tuesday, still in silence.

My mind's response to knowing this: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

Why does it seem, if not scary, then very unsettling to sit in silence? I have no idea.
