We are watching an old series called _6 Feet Under_. Much of the show revolves around the family's occupation in "death-services". They own a funeral home and perform the embalming and restoration of the dead.

My view on death generally has evolved over the past ten years. From never having thought about it, to being scared of death for myself and loved ones, to where it stands now: It will suck living with without the ones we care about. 

Death is just the absence of all the good parts of life -- laughing, growing, and struggling together. And death sucks not because it is scary, but because it will deprive us of being together, knowing each other, and letting others know how important they are to you.

Other than prompting you to think about death, it is a great show full of wonderful, albeit sometimes dark, emotions.
