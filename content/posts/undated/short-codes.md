One nice feature of blogging with Hugo are [short codes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/). You can include pretty much anything in a blog post without the need to write or re-right much HTML. For example to include a YouTube video you simply type "youtube" followed by the video id inside of double squiggly braces and angled brackets. Super simple. This will make it easier to expand on interesting tweets, fun code snippets, and most importantly videos of my golf swing. 

This one is taken from earlier this summer. Wow, is that ugly.
