One of the strange lingering effects of coming off of retreat is the change in attitude to what had previously been thought of as obligations; they now have a different feel to them. Rather than being burdensome, they are perfectly timed manifestations of my values and nature. They are a chance to do what I think is correct and what would bring about the most happiness.

I have even gone as far as thinking "obligations are not a real thing". I'm really not obligated to anything or anyone. I'm not obligated to cook dinner. I'm not obligated to treat my girlfriend with any decency at all. Nor am I obligated to care for my Grandfather. I (attempt) to do all these things as they are no more than and no less than my cherished values and silly human nature projected on the task at hand.
