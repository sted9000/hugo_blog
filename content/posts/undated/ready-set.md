I'm all set for a marathon attempt this Thursday. No more running between now and then. I have the socks washed, the gels bought, and the route planned. Mica even is planning to meet me halfway with a bottle of water. 

The only thing left to do is run the darn thing (and worry). No music, no watch. Just man vs his mind. I am very excited. Wish me luck.
