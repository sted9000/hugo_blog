One of the great joys in my life is *practical philosophy â€”* the exploration of ideas that can be implemented in our lives.

My interest started with Daniel Khaneman's *Thinking Fast and Slow* over ten years ago and continues today.

What a marvel that brilliant people can take experience, convert it into abstract ideas, and then package and share it in a way that we can experience it ourselves.

Perhaps an example to close from Daniel Khaneman's work. The idea of having two distinct *selves:* one who experiences and one who remembers. Each self brings its unique motivations to the table when evaluating a decision that is upon you...

I won't expand any further, but this idea and ideas like it are so useful. I love it.
