One of the many things I love about my counselor is that they can laugh.

They laugh if I happen to say something funny (a rarity).

And they laugh when they say something funny.

I find the fact that they have this ability to be wonderful and insightful. Almost by definition, I talk to my counselor about issues that are causing me distress and doubt. Having a laugh is nice to balance things out.

Going a step further into speculation, it might be the case that availability of laughter helps me clarify issues. It permits me to look at issues squarely, rather than merely acknowledge their existence. And it might *give me permission* to look at them with a healthfully detached point of view.

Que se yo?
