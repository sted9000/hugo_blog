Mica and I are enjoying [The All In Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/all-in-with-chamath-jason-sacks-friedberg/id1502871393) in all of its weirdness. It's weird, both as in very (W)estern (E)ducated (I)ndustrial (R)ich (D)emocracy and it the personalities of the cast. They talk about current trends in tech, finance, culture, and politics with a give-no-fucks attitude. They all have unique yet overlapping perspectives they gained while becoming successful founders and investors. Combine that with a lot of ego, playfulness, and a gambler's spirit... and it is quite an enjoyable (and perhaps educational) hour every week.

I highly recommend it
