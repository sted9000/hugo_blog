If this exists, please tell me about it. If not, please take this idea and create it.

Everyday I see people driving distracted while looking at their phones. It's a medium sized problem that needs to go away. Now. There is no reason for it. We are just being stubborn and slow to adapt as a culture. People are getting hurt and dying.

In the U.S. in 2018, over 2,800 people were killed and an estimated 400,000 were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver.  â€” CDC

The app would provide incentives for drivers to not use their phone while driving. The incentives could come in the form of public shaming or financial motivations.

If you use your phone while driving, an automatic twitter post get's published from your handle reading "I just drove while distracted. I could have killed someone because I wanted to see if I had any new messages. Shame on me".

Or your bank account could be debited for $500 dollars because you decided to check your messages at while driving home from work.

The idea is to properly incentivize us to act wisely.
