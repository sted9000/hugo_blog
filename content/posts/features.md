Today I only had a few minutes, so the site only got a title, subtitle, github link, and a simple navigation bar. This weekend I hope to make a dent into the following list of features: 

- Auto posting script
- Tags or Categories taxonomy
- GPT3 backup poster
- Migrate the posts from the prior blog
- An archive for finding older posts
- Avatar / Site Logo
- About page (that includes a count of consecutive days posted)
- Resources page
