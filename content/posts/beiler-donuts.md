I loved Krispy Kreme doughnuts growing up. I could eat 6 glazed for breakfast, no problem. They were the best doughnuts in the world.

I was wrong. Boy, was I wrong. And I have never been so content to be!

[Beiler's Doughnuts](https://www.beilersdoughnuts.com/) are the best doughnuts in the world. They are made fresh daily by Pennsylvania dutch. They are the plutonic form of a doughnut. They couldn't be any better. My mouth is watering writing this.

If you are every in Philly, do yourself a favor and get one (or two). Mica's favorite is the Boston Creme and I go with the Blueberry Fritter.
