A strange thought I had on my meditation retreat: "There are lots of different types of business models". And I would like to further explore which work best in which context. Today, however, let's start with a simple list of ten different business models:

1. Pay-per-item
2. Subscription
3. Freemium
4. Public Non profit
5. Private Non profit
6. Charity / Dana (Buddhist monasteries have been wholly supported by the goodwill of the the community called Dana for thousands of years)
7. Open source (free stuff supported by corporation's pragmatism and marketing)
8. Individually funded project / side project with small chance of monetary
9. Advertising
10. Selling data
