Today is the first of twenty-one pre-written blog posts â€” as I will be without a connection for the next three weeks. I am sitting down with a cup of coffee and intend to write them all today. My guess is that it will take me around six hours to finish and at the end I will have a much clearer head. I will circle back and finish this post after all other posts have been completed.

Done!

It took all day and was highly enjoyable. I have poured everything out and have nothing left to say... other than I hope you enjoy and that the auto-poster works :)

See you on the flip side.
