I want to have musical skills. And I want them for only two reasons. And the reasons are very weird and perhaps creepy:

1. To perform a song at funerals of people I love.
2. So I can write and play songs like Adam Sandler's [Hanukkah Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUCNAnp2QAI) or [Phone Wallet Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9N6_Tj9u2U).
