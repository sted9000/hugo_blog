Another way of putting *being kind to yourself* is *being friends with your mind*. And while most people think of themselves and their minds as the same thing, I think everyone can get the gist of *being friends with your mind*. Your mind is the thing — "the one" — that comes up with all the thoughts and judgements of both yourself and the rest of the world. You are in a relationship with your mind.

And if you accept that, why not have a friendly relationship with your mind? After all, it is the longest and most intimate relationship you could ever possibly have.
