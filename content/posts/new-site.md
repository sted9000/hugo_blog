We have a new site! While it is currently worse than the old site, it is better in a few ways under the hood. And over the next two weeks I plan on making it bearable to read.

It is built with Hugo, which as far as I can tell is better than Jekyll in almost every regard. And the best part is that it is built on top of AWS Amplify which will allow all sorts of scripts and upgrades.

Also, a big thank you to [Jonny](https://www.jonnyspicer.com) for the link to [this great tutorial](https://www.outcoldman.com/en/archive/2021/01/21/scheduled-aws-amplify-builds/) which will allow me to magically post everyday while I am away on retreat disconnected from the world. 

My girlfriend Mica is getting tired of going to bed alone because I am writing my blog. But, I am once again finding it enjoyable and want to continue to write, share, and build.

Be well.
